 ## Introduction
This is an example application I have created in my spare time to make use of the MinIO SDK for Java. 

I hope that this will serve as an example for future developers trying to create any app that uses MinIO as a storage. :smiley: 

The application is still being developed so please be aware this is totally not the best practice.

## Prerequisites

This project only helps you create a phone application that connects to a MinIO Object Storage and make use of the tools they have provided. In order to create the server that runs in the background see MinIO official documentation [here](https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-quickstart-guide.html).

After you have that going, all you need is to configure this application to connect to the specific server you are running. 
 ## Application usage

This app can be used to create your own drive storage.
